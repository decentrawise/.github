## Indie Protocol

We are a collective of web3 enabled creators and developers that decided to come together with the purpose of rethinking the incentive structures for digital content creators! üëç

### Problem we are trying to solve:

- Intellectual property rights laws from centuries ago protecting content creators and artists of the digital media age is not working
- Digital media content is not a scarce asset, as anyone can copy it and the "copy" is exactly equal to the "original"
- DRM has failed to protect the authors and imposed too many restrictions on content distribution and accessibility
- Pay-per-play models also failed to build sustainable markets, having to rely on advertisement to "foot the bill" and annoy users to make them pay
- All existing models gate access to digital media content by reducing visibility and exposure which counters creators audience building needs
- Web3 gives us the tools needed to build new business models, but all that has been done so far is implementing the same models and expect different results

### Baseline questions we will be thinking differently about:

- Should we continue to look at digital copies as something scarce and valuable?
- What if digital artists and creators are "selling" the wrong product? Maybe the digital copies are not the product...
- Why can't digital collectibles (NFT) be used to create new truly scarce items that fans would love to collect? Just not pixelated jpegs...
- What about liberating the digital art content from decades of platform constraints, publishing it to a single decentralized registry, globally accessible to all platforms?
- Maybe then platforms and apps could concentrate in building alternative engagement and incentivization strategies for fans to interact with creators? And keep a fair fee...
- Imagining all this, wouldn't life be great for creators and fans?
  
    - Free access to all content (but keep full IP)
    - Publish once to all platforms
    - New ways to support favorite creators
    - Exclusive perks for super-fans
    - No app or platform could de-platform or de-monetize creators
    - App builders focus on new engagement options for user retention since content is globally available and copyright free
    - Creators can try out in parallel with the legacy systems and check what works best
    - Users can choose the platform based on the engagement and not by the access or content availability
    - User generated content (collections, liked content, etc) can also be made portable from platform to platform
    - ...
